            Read Dead Redemption 2 is the third installment in the Read Dead franchise, and a prequel to Red Dead Redemption.
            The story follows Arthur Morgan who is an outlaw in the Van Der Lande Gang, who deals with the changing world and decline
            of the wild west. Throughout the story the gang is on the run from the Pinkertons, a government agency, and other gangs.
            The gameplay is heavily focused on the wild west theme, with stagecoach robberies, horseback riding, and shootouts.
            The story changes based on your character Arhur Morgans honor which is affected by your choices throughout the game.
